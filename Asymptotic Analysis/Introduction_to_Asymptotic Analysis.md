## Prelude

Algorithmic complexity is a very important topic in computer science. Knowing the complexity of algorithms allows you to answer questions such as
How long will a program run on an input?
How much space will it take?
Is the problem solvable?
These are important bases of comparison between different algorithms.
**An understanding of algorithmic complexity provides programmers with insight into the efficiency of their code.** Complexity is also important to several theoretical areas in computer science, including algorithms, data structures, and complexity theory.
